                <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
                <p>
                    Table Raid is a gesture based VR game created in 'Media Technology - Bachelor Project TNM094' at Link√∂pings University
                    during 12 weeks by a group of 5 people. The main focus of the course was to create a larger project and gain experience
                    in system development and agile development.


                    <br></br>
                    Ill present those parts of the project that I was most involved with which include general game design, VR integration, 
                    gesture recognition system, abilities system and the multiplayer aspect.
                    
                </p>
