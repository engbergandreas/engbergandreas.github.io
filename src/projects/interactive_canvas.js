                <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
                <p>
                    Implementation of NVIDIA's generative SPADE network in PyTorch. Based on the original paper of Park et.al.
                    GauGAN is a generative network with a special normalization method SPADE, the generator takes as input a 
                    segmentation mask and a corresponding real image or noise vector in a high dimensional space and synthesize a 
                    photorealistic image as output. Depending on the dataset used during training it is capable of multi-modal 
                    image synthesis, which means that it can generate images in various different styles using the same input 
                    segmentation mask. In my implementation I trained the network on parts of COCO-Stuff dataset for about 160 epochs 
                    on my home computer which limit the rendering capabilities of the network. Beside the network I also created an 
                    interactive app hosted on streamlit, where you can draw your own doodles and turn them into semi-photorealistic images.

                <h2>Architecture</h2>
                <p>
                The network consists of an encoder, generator, and discriminator, all working together to produce photorealistic images 
                given a noise vector and segmentation mask.

                <h2>App</h2>
                <p>
                    An interactive application was written in Python and hosted on <i>streamlit</i>. It allows a user to draw semantic doodles 
                    in an interactive canvas and generate a photorealistic image in real time. 
                    Test the app yourself at <ReferenceLink reference={"https://engbergandreas-gaugan.streamlit.app/"} text={"https://engbergandreas-gaugan.streamlit.app/"} />.
                    For ease of use and for better visualization each class in COCO-Stuff is mapped to a random color, furthermore, 
                    the number of classes is limited to make the interface more readable.
